Master's in Applied Data Science @ UChicago  

I'm a Master's student in [Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) at the University of Chicago, passionate about machine learning, big data, and AI-driven problem-solving. With experience in Python, SQL, PySpark, and data analytics, I thrive on transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. I have a background in big data, risk assessment, and cloud computing, with hands-on experience in consulting and research. Currently, I'm exploring deep learning and its applications in finance and trading. Always eager to learn and collaborate, I aim to bridge the gap between data science and real-world decision-making.
